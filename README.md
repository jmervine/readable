# readable

`readable` is a simple Golang logger based loosely on the 12 Factor Logs (http://12factor.net/logs) and backed by Goalng's built in `log` package.

## notes on thread safety

The [Go `log` package](http://godoc.org/log), which is the underlying implementation is suppose to be thread safe,
however, with my testing, when using buffers ([`bytes.Buffer`](http://godoc.org/bytes#Buffer)), it proved not to be in conjunction
with `With{*}` style setters. This shouldn't be an issue when  [`os.Stdout`](http://godoc.org/os#Stdout) and
[`os.Stderr`](http://godoc.org/os#Stderr) should be as safe as the standard `log` package.

To be safe, I've added `LogSafe` as a guaranteed thread safe logger, but it's a little slower than the standard logging.
Additionally, this should be used when using `With{*}` style setters in line, to ensure thread safety. Otherwise, there's
a good chance it won't be, as stated above. Example:

```go
// maybe not safe
go func() {
    readable.WithPrefix("foo").Log("bar")
    // do stuff
}()

// guaranteed safe
go func() {
    readable.WithPrefix("foo").LogSafe("bar")
    // do stuff
}()
```

## usage

```go
package main

import "gopkg.in/jmervine/readable.v1"

func main() {
    readable.Log("type", "default", "fn", "Log")
    // 2015/08/23 19:17:38 type=default fn=Log

    readable.SetFlags(0)
    readable.Log("type", "without data stamp", "fn", "Log")
    // type=without data stamp fn=Log

    readable.SetFormatter(readable.Join)
    readable.Log("type", "with Join formatter", "fn", "Log")
    // type: with Join formatter fn: Log

    logger := readable.New().WithPrefix("[INFO]:")
    debugger := readable.New().WithDebug().WithPrefix("[DEBUG]:")

    logger.Log("type", "logger", "fn", "Log")
    logger.Debug("type", "logger", "fn", "Debug")
    logger.WithDebug().Debug("type", "logger", "fn", "WithDebug().Debug")
    // 2015/08/23 19:17:38 [INFO]: type=logger fn=Log
    // 2015/08/23 19:17:38 [INFO]: type=logger fn=WithDebug().Debug

    debugger.Log("type", "debugger", "fn", "Log")
    debugger.Debug("type", "debuger", "fn", "Debug")
    // 2015/08/23 19:17:38 [DEBUG]: type=debugger fn=Log
    // 2015/08/23 19:17:38 [DEBUG]: type=debugger fn=Debug
}
```

## performance

`readable` performs a little slower then the default Go logger. `With{*}` setter
convenience methods, do impact performance, so keep that in mind where performance
is king.
